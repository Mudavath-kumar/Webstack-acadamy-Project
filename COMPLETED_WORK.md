## 🔧 Technical Changes Made

### API Configuration (Critical Fix)
```javascript
// Before (broken on Vercel):

```

### Profile Page Features
```javascript
// Account Tab
- View/edit name, email, phone, bio
- Save changes to backend
- Delete account option

// Security Tab  
- Change password
- Current password verification
- New password validation

// Preferences Tab
- Email notifications toggle
- Push notifications toggle
- Marketing emails toggle

// Avatar Upload
- File selection
- Type validation (images only)
- Size validation (max 5MB)
- Preview before upload
- Upload to server
```

### Redux Integration
```javascript
// Connected to store
import { useSelector, useDispatch } from 'react-redux';
import { updatePassword } from '../store/slices/authSlice';

// Real-time state updates
const user = useSelector((state) => state.auth.user);
dispatch(updatePassword({ currentPassword, newPassword }));
```

### API Endpoints Used
```javascript
// Authentication
POST /api/v1/auth/register
POST /api/v1/auth/login
PUT /api/v1/auth/updatepassword

// User Profile
GET /api/v1/users/profile
PUT /api/v1/users/profile
```
