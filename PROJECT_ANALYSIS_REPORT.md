### 9. Known Issues & Warnings

#### ⚠️ Warnings (Non-Critical)
1. **MongoDB Driver Deprecation Warnings**
   - `useNewUrlParser` is deprecated (no effect since v4.0.0)
   - `useUnifiedTopology` is deprecated (no effect since v4.0.0)
   - **Impact:** None - these are informational warnings
   - **Action:** Can be safely removed from database config

2. **Razorpay Configuration**
   - Running with demo/test keys
   - Warning displayed: "Razorpay not configured - running in development mode"
   - **Impact:** Payment testing will work, but requires real keys for production
   - **Action:** Update with real keys before deployment

3. **Cloudinary Configuration**
   - Running with demo credentials
   - **Impact:** Image upload will fail in production
   - **Action:** Update with real Cloudinary credentials before deployment

4. **NPM Audit**
   - 3 moderate severity vulnerabilities detected in backend
   - **Action:** Run `npm audit fix` when ready for production

#### 🚫 Missing Features
Based on the rollback, these features may need to be re-implemented:
1. **Dedicated Login/Signup Pages**
   - Current: Uses modal-based authentication
   - **Note:** Modal authentication is working via AuthModal component
   - If separate pages are needed, they need to be created

2. **Toast Notifications**
   - `react-hot-toast` is installed but not integrated in App.jsx
   - **Action:** Add `<Toaster />` component to App.jsx for notifications

3. **Protected Routes**
   - No ProtectedRoute component in current App.jsx
   - **Action:** Add route protection for authenticated pages

4. **Upload Routes**
   - Upload controller and routes exist but may not be mounted
   - **Action:** Verify upload routes are mounted in server.js

---

## 🎯 Next Steps & Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Priority: HIGH)

1. **Add Toast Notifications to App** ⭐
   ```javascript
   // Add to src/App.jsx
   import { Toaster } from 'react-hot-toast';
   // Add <Toaster /> component in the return statement
   ```

2. **Verify Upload Routes** ⭐
   ```javascript
   // Check server/server.js
   // Ensure upload routes are mounted:
   // app.use('/api/v1/upload', uploadRoutes);
   ```

3. **Remove MongoDB Deprecation Warnings** ⭐
   ```javascript
   // Update server/config/database.js
   // Remove useNewUrlParser and useUnifiedTopology
   ```

4. **Add Protected Route Wrapper** ⭐
   - Create/verify ProtectedRoute component
   - Wrap protected routes in App.jsx

### Short-term Improvements (Priority: MEDIUM)
