## 🔧 Key Changes Made

### 1. Payment System (MongoDB-based)

**New Payment Model** (`backend/models/Payment.js`):
```javascript
- booking: Reference to Booking
- user: Reference to User
- property: Reference to Property
- amount: Payment amount
- currency: USD, EUR, GBP, INR, etc.
- paymentMethod: card, upi, netbanking, wallet, cash
- status: pending, processing, completed, failed, refunded
- transactionId: Unique transaction ID
- orderId: Order ID
- paidAt: Payment timestamp
- paymentDetails: Card info, UPI ID, etc.
- charges: Breakdown of fees
- And more...
```

**New Payment Flow**:
1. User creates booking
2. System creates payment order in MongoDB
3. Payment is processed (simulated for now)
4. Payment verified and booking confirmed
5. All payment data stored in MongoDB

**Benefits**:
- ✅ No external payment gateway dependency
- ✅ Full control over payment data
- ✅ Easy to add real payment gateway later (Stripe, PayPal, etc.)
- ✅ Complete payment history in database
- ✅ Support for refunds and cancellations
- ✅ Payment analytics and reporting

### 2. Frontend Updates

**CheckoutEnhanced.jsx**:
- ❌ Removed Razorpay script loading
- ❌ Removed Razorpay options and configuration
- ✅ Added MongoDB-based payment flow
- ✅ Simplified payment processing
- ✅ Better error handling

**API Service** (`frontend/src/services/api.js`):
- ✅ Added `processPayment()` method
- ✅ Added `getUserPayments()` method
- ✅ All payment endpoints integrated

### 3. Backend Updates

**Payment Controller** (`backend/controllers/paymentController.js`):
- ✅ Complete rewrite to use MongoDB
- ✅ Added payment order creation
- ✅ Added payment processing
- ✅ Added payment verification
- ✅ Added payment history
- ✅ Added refund processing
- ✅ Added payment statistics
- ✅ No external dependencies

**Payment Routes** (`backend/routes/payments.js`):
