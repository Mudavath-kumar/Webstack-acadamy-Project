## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Blank Host Dashboard
**Solution**: Already fixed! ProtectedRoute now checks both auth systems.

### Issue: Cannot access property images
**Solution**: Use full URLs or Cloudinary links in property form.

### Issue: Payment fails
**Solution**: Ensure property ID is valid (not "demo-property").

### Issue: OTP not received
**Solution**: Check backend logs, OTP stored in MongoDB OTP collection.

### Issue: Session lost on refresh
**Solution**: Already implemented! Tokens stored in localStorage.

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **For Development**: Use Redux DevTools to inspect state
2. **For Testing**: Open browser console to see API calls
3. **For Debugging**: Check backend logs in terminal
4. **For Properties**: Use high-quality images from Unsplash
5. **For Demo**: Create multiple properties to test listing grid
6. **For Booking**: Use future dates for check-in/check-out
7. **For Payments**: Test with any card number (development mode)
8. **For OTP**: Check MongoDB OTP collection for codes
