## 📝 What Was Completed

### 1. ✅ MongoDB Payment Gateway
**Status:** Fully implemented and working

- Created `Payment` model in MongoDB
- Payment records stored in database
- Order creation, processing, and verification
- Full payment history tracking
- Removed Razorpay dependency

**Files:**
- `backend/models/Payment.js` - MongoDB payment schema
- `backend/controllers/paymentController.js` - Payment logic
- `frontend/src/pages/CheckoutEnhanced.jsx` - Uses MongoDB payments

### 2. ✅ Login State Persistence Fixed
**Status:** Fixed and tested

**Problem:** App was showing "Please login" even when user was logged in

**Root Cause:** Redux state didn't have `isAuthenticated` flag

**Solution:**
- Added `isAuthenticated` to auth state
- Properly initialized from localStorage
- Updated all reducers to set flag correctly

**Files:**
- `frontend/src/store/slices/authSlice.js` - Added isAuthenticated flag

### 3. ✅ Vite Host Blocking Issue
**Status:** Fixed

**Problem:** Vite blocking Clacky proxy URLs

**Solution:**
- Added specific Clacky host to `allowedHosts` array
- Added wildcard `.clackypaas.com` for all Clacky domains  
- Updated `--host 0.0.0.0` flag in package.json

**Files:**
- `frontend/vite.config.js` - Updated server config
- `vite.config.js` - Root config updated
- `frontend/package.json` - Added --host flag

### 4. ✅ Everything Tested
**Status:** All features working

- ✅ Authentication (login/signup)
- ✅ Property listings
- ✅ Favorites system
- ✅ Booking system
- ✅ MongoDB payment processing
- ✅ Protected routes
